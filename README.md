My talk from CopenhagenJS the 21st of February 2013.
The slides are located in the slides folder.

To run the test case do:

	node test.js simple.js
	node test.js functional.js
	node test.js generated.js

You can run the benchmarks for each of the implementations by doing:

	node benchmark.js simple.js
	node benchmark.js functional.js
	node benchmark.js generated.js
